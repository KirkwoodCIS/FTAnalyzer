* Clear all the "Fields Required" except "Date"  
* Hit "OK" and then "Close"   

then add facts as normal. Note you should just enter the year against the new Lost Cousins fact there is no need to enter a full date. Similarly you should have separate Lost Cousins facts for each Lost Cousins census the person was recorded on. Each fact will have a different year against it.
