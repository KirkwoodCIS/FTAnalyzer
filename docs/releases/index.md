## FTAnalyzer Releases  

If you prefer a manual install method, you can download a zip file from the [releases page](https://github.com/ShammyLevva/FTAnalyzer/releases)

This can be installed by simply unzipping the file into any directory that isn't a locked directory. Note that Windows locks program files and program files (x86) directories from use by manual install apps.  

The program can then be started by creating a shortcut to FTAnalyzer.exe
